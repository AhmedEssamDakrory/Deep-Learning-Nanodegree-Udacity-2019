# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity-2019
This repo contains my journey taking the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) with Udacity!! In the nanodegree, we will become experts in neural networks, and we are going to learn how to implement them using the famous deep learning framework like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. We will also learn how to build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.



## Program Structure

The Deep Learning Nanodegree program is divided into five parts, giving you a thorough understanding of deep learning, and covering some of the major topics. You can download the complete syllabus of the program from [here](), but here is a glimpse if you are too lazy!!!
