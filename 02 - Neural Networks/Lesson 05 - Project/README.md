# Bike Sharing Project

For the first project, we'll build a neural network to predict bike-sharing rides. 

Imagine yourself owning a bike sharing company like [Cycle Hop](https://cyclehop.com). You want to protect how many bikes you need because if you have too few you're losing money from potential riders. If you have too many you're wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. So you need to predict from historical data how many bikes you'll need in the near future.

 A good way to do this is with a neural network which is exactly what you'll do. In this notebook, you'll implement a neural network and train it on historical data to make predictions. After training the network and viewing its performance as it's being trained, you'll compare your networks predictions with actual data. If you build your network right you should find the network does a really good job, for the most part. Right! It's time for you to get started on your project.

 Good luck!
